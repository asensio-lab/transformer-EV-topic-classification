87311,"I have successfully charged at the quick-charger there about 2x per month (i.e.: on a round-trip through Tucson) over the last few months.  I did this again last night.  There are some details that might be useful, and there are a couple of negatives that should be improved so I will list them:
- it looks like they have replaced the nearby L2 with GoE3 equipment.  I haven't tried this equipment yet.
- I am still not sure sometimes how to get quick-charging to go all the way to 100%.
- There are some large garbage containers blocking the parking spot about 30 feet opposite the parking spot for the Quick-charger.  They do not prevent use of the charger, but make it a bit needlessly difficult to pull in properly to it, and make you feel a bit less welcome.  This is a problem that should get solved, permanently, but hasn't.  All that needs to happen is that the location for these containers be moved several (largely unused) parking spots to the East or West.  
- Last night when I charged, it took me about 5 minutes of fiddling with the computer screens and start button to get it to work.  This was unusual and a little disconcerting (if the charger had not worked, I would have had to wait for hours while the L2 charger worked for me).  I suggest that GoE3 revisit the site with a Leaf or other quick-chargeable vehicle and verify what is happening with respect to that issue.
- in the six months since the charger opened, I think they have made it free, but then they were I think planning to transition it to a pay scheme (I don't know how much per charge).  I would be fine to pay.
- This is still the only 24x7 quick-charger in Tucson (Jim Click I think is behind their fence and so generally not useful to me) and so it is still, IMO, the most important charger in Arizona south of the Picacho Peak and Casa Grande  quick-chargers.  So, we drivers should maintain good communication about it.
- I stopped by the quick-charger that was supposedly under construction at Speedway and I-10 Arco, and asked, and they said they were removing it.  I don't know if it will be replaced by anything, but that brings home that for now this Bookman's charger is vital.",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Plugshare and EZ-Charge apps under their current design should have separate listings for L3s so that status (like under repair) and alerts (like all stations in use and station has become available) make sense for real human EV users.    
                                                 Nissan advertises 30 minutes free with NCTC on L3s. Unfortunately, they are failing to be honest in several ways:

0. Many stations are out of order, but not listed as such on the advertising posters in Nissan dealerships or in the EZ-Charge app, which has a special icon for under repair. In Phoenix, about 5 of 21 stations are currently out of order but still using the normally working icon.

1. They do not provide 30-minute free sessions.

2. They fail to time the sessions for you.

3. They fail to cut off the session at 30 minutes.

4. If you go over, they charge you $7. This requires you to leave work or whatever you are doing, exactly in time to cut it off. If you leave too early, then you cut your session short. If you leave right on time, you must still cut your session a little short to avoid going over the 30 minutes on your own timing.

5. They refuse to document or provide measures for when the timer starts and when it ends.

6. When touch screens do not work, you cannot use NCTC over app or telephone. They say you can dispute it later, but their dispute process is opaque and time consuming. That is not a free 30-minute charge, either.

7. What they should have done, and what they probably originally meant to do, is simply provide $7 fast charges for free to NCTC customers.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
